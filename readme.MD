# img-share README
Hey! I found a tutorial [here] (http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-nodejs-and-websockets-to-build-a-chat-service--net-34482)

And hacked a little bit more (also to make it work after breaking changes) and this is the result - a chat to share links to images.

What to do:

npm install

node server.js

head to localhost:8888

Enjoy!
